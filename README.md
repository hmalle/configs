# terminalconfig
configuration scripts for terminal environment

move vimrc to home directory and rename it to .vimrc
``` mv vimrc ~/.vimrc ```

do the same above step for bashrc and tmux(if you have tmux installed)
Configure your bashrc properly, your system might have .bash_profile, 
so call .bashrc from your .bash_profile
